## :dart: Objective
Develop the front-end of an application with a primary focus on allowing the user to find the climate of a specific city according to their search.

## :pushpin: Challenge
Use a climate API in order to understand the concepts of use with React and how to obtain this data. In this app I used the [Open Weather API](https://openweathermap.org/api), which is perfect for the purpose, it brings all the content in JSON format, which facilitates integration with the front-end.
